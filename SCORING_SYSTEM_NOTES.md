# üéØ Late Corner Scoring System - Technical Notes

## ‚è∞ **PRECISION TIMING UPDATE: Exact 85th Minute Alerts (2025-07-28)**

### **üéØ EXACT 85:00 TIMING IMPLEMENTED**
Changed from "85+ minute window" to **precise 85th minute targeting** for maximum betting advantage!

**Old System:** Alerts sent anytime from 85:00-90:00+  
**New System:** Alerts sent in 84:30-85:15 window (targets exactly 85:00)

### **‚ö° Enhanced Timing Configuration:**
- **Polling Interval:** Reduced from 60s to 15s for precision
- **Alert Window:** 84:xx-85:xx only (not 86+ minutes)  
- **Target:** Exactly 85:00 minute mark
- **Buffer:** Small window for API timing variations

### **üìä Real-World Timeline:**
```
84:45 - System checks ‚Üí Ready to alert
85:00 - System checks ‚Üí ALERT SENT! ‚ö° (perfect timing)
85:15 - System checks ‚Üí No new alerts (already sent)
86:00 - System checks ‚Üí No alerts (outside window)
```

## üöÄ **MAJOR UPGRADE: Period-Based Statistics Integration (2025-07-28)**

### **BREAKTHROUGH: True "Recent Activity" Detection**
Implemented SportMonks `periods.statistics` to get **second half statistics** instead of total match stats. This is a **huge improvement** in accuracy!

**Before:** Used total match stats as weak proxy for recent activity  
**After:** Use actual 2nd half statistics for precise recent activity detection

### **New Capabilities:**
‚úÖ **Second half shots on target** (much more accurate than total)  
‚úÖ **Second half dangerous attacks** (shows current pressure)  
‚úÖ **Second half crosses** (indicates current attacking style)  
‚úÖ **Second half offsides** (shows desperation level)  
‚úÖ **All scoring criteria now use period-level granularity**

### **Improved Thresholds (Much More Realistic):**
**Before (Total Match):** 8+ shots on target = high activity  
**After (2nd Half Only):** 5+ shots on target = high activity  

**Before (Total Match):** 10+ crosses = high activity  
**After (2nd Half Only):** 6+ crosses = high activity  

**Logic:** Second half stats are much more relevant for 85+ minute corner prediction!

### **Technical Implementation:**
- Added `periods.statistics` to SportMonks API includes
- Enhanced MatchStats with `second_half_stats` field
- Created `_extract_second_half_stats()` method
- Updated all scoring conditions to use 2nd half data

## ‚úÖ **FIXED: Critical Scoring Engine Issues (2025-07-28)**

### **Problem Identified:**
The original scoring system was **partially broken** - it attempted to calculate "last X minutes" statistics but the required functions were missing, causing alerts to only trigger on basic criteria.

### **What Was Broken:**
‚ùå `_get_last_minutes_stat()` function didn't exist  
‚ùå Time-windowed statistics (last 15min, last 10min, etc.)  
‚ùå Most high-value scoring criteria were never triggered  

### **What We Fixed:**
‚úÖ **Enhanced favorite/team trailing logic** - now specifically targets 1-goal deficits  
‚úÖ **Implemented proxy-based scoring** - uses total match stats + timing as activity indicators  
‚úÖ **Fixed all scoring calculations** - system now actually awards points for high activity  
‚úÖ **Added defensive programming** - uses `.get()` to handle missing data gracefully  

## üìä **Current Scoring Logic (Production Ready)**

### **High Priority (3-5 points):**
- **Favorite trailing by 1 goal after 80'** ‚Üí 6 points (5 + 1 bonus)
- **Favorite drawing after 80'** ‚Üí 4 points (5 - 1 penalty)  
- **Any team trailing by 1 goal after 80'** ‚Üí 4 points
- **High shots on target (8+) in late game** ‚Üí 4 points
- **High dangerous attacks (8+) in late game** ‚Üí 4 points
- **High shots blocked (6+) in late game** ‚Üí 4 points
- **High big chances (4+) in late game** ‚Üí 4 points

### **Medium Priority (2-3 points):**
- **High shots inside box (6+) in late game** ‚Üí 3 points
- **Hit woodwork 3+ times** ‚Üí 3 points
- **High crosses (10+) in late game** ‚Üí 2 points
- **High possession (65%+)** ‚Üí 2 points

### **Tactical Indicators (1-2 points):**
- **Attacking substitution after 70'** ‚Üí 2 points
- **High successful dribbles (8+) in late game** ‚Üí 1 point
- **High offsides (4+) = desperate attacking** ‚Üí 1 point
- **High throwins (12+) = pressure play** ‚Üí 1 point
- **Low pass accuracy (<75%) = rushed play** ‚Üí 1 point

### **Corner Context:**
- **8-11 total corners at 85' (sweet spot)** ‚Üí 3 points
- **6-7 corners (positive)** ‚Üí 1 point
- **5 or fewer corners (red flag)** ‚Üí -2 points

### **Time Multipliers:**
- **80-90 minutes:** 1.5x multiplier
- **90+ minutes:** 2.0x multiplier

## üîß **Technical Implementation Notes**

### **Proxy-Based Approach:**
Since SportMonks API provides total match statistics (not time-windowed), we use:
- **High total stats + late game timing** = proxy for recent activity
- **Threshold adjustments** to account for full-match vs recent activity
- **Minute >= 70-75 filters** to ensure late-game context

### **Data Safety:**
- All stat lookups use `.get(team_focus, 0)` to handle missing data
- Default values prevent crashes on incomplete API responses
- Graceful degradation when optional stats unavailable

## üöÄ **Scoring Improvements Delivered:**

1. **Favorite Logic Enhanced:**
   - Now specifically targets 1-goal deficits (highest corner probability)
   - Separate scoring for drawing vs trailing scenarios
   - Secondary scoring for any team trailing by 1

2. **Activity Detection Fixed:**
   - System now actually detects high-activity matches
   - Proper scoring for shots, attacks, chances, etc.
   - Late-game timing requirements ensure relevance

3. **Production Stability:**
   - No more missing function crashes
   - Handles incomplete API data gracefully
   - Detailed logging for debugging

## üìà **Expected Performance Impact:**

**Before Fix:** Only ~3-4 scoring criteria working (basic corner count + favorite status)  
**After Fix:** All 15+ scoring criteria working (comprehensive analysis)

**Expected Alert Frequency:** Should increase significantly as more criteria now trigger  
**Expected Accuracy:** Should improve as system detects actual late-game pressure patterns

## üîÆ **Future Enhancements (V2):**

1. **True Time-Windowed Stats:**
   - Store historical snapshots every 5 minutes
   - Calculate real "last 15 minutes" differences
   - More precise recent activity detection

2. **Machine Learning Integration:**
   - Historical corner outcome tracking
   - Pattern recognition for optimal alert timing
   - Dynamic threshold adjustment based on league/team patterns

3. **Advanced Event Detection:**
   - Substitution type analysis (attacking vs defensive)
   - Formation change detection
   - Momentum shift indicators
