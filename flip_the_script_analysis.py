FLIP THE SCRIPT ANALYSIS
========================

If we're betting "Over 2 more corners" and losing, what if we bet "Under 2 more corners" instead?

Current Logic:
- WIN = 2+ more corners happened
- LOSS = 0 more corners happened  
- REFUND = exactly 1 more corner happened

Flipped Logic (Under 2 more corners):
- WIN = 0 or 1 more corners happened (original LOSS + REFUND)
- LOSS = 2+ more corners happened (original WIN)

This flips our terrible win rates into potentially profitable ones!
